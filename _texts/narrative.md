## Editor's note

This version of *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass* was adapted from *The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass*. The [Guttenberg file](http://www.gutenberg.org/) does not tell us which witness was used in making their digital edition. The edition below is only a slightly modified version of the Guttenberg text, and therefore should not be taken too seriously as an edition. I use the text mostly to show a few affordances of using Ed for long form narrative. This page, for example, showcases a different sidebar than the rest of our sample site, with a table of content of the novel generated out of metadata in the source file. In addition, reading morsels of the novel on your different devices can give you a sense of the experience of reading prose using Ed, and shows you an example of the optional sidebar with a table of contents. A few other features of this page are described in more detail in the [Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/).

Diarmait O’Mahony, plaintiff
 
Richard, Earl of Cork, defendant
 
Forasmuch as the plaintiff hath attended [court] all this term and hath at several times moved by his counsel to have a trial in indifferent county for the lands in controversy according to the direction of his Majesty’s counsel in England and several orders made in this court in pursuing the said directions; whereupon day hath been given to the defendant to show cause for why the said directions and orders should not be pursued and put in execution, which as yet he hath not done: It is therefore ordered in favor of the said defendant that the first day of the next Trinity term is given to the defendants to show cause wherefore he should not give his assent to an indifferent trial in an indifferent county, otherwise to be heard and determined in this court, if it please the defendant to assent thereunto – of which the plaintiff is willing and contented to submit himself and his case.
